The final project for the course Designing and Conducting an EEG study in VR, SS22 at Osnabrück University.

The project is created by Pelin Kömürlüoğlu, pkoemuerlueo@uos.de.

This project is a pilot study to design in VR and record the brain activity with EEG. The project explores the accuracy and reaction times of the subjects in Approximate Number System (ANS) task. The experiment has 2 stages. During the first stage, the subjects explore 7 different notes on their keyboard, from A-J on a German keyboard setting, and are asked to come up with their own musical sequence consisted of 4 notes. At the second stage, they are presented with an ANS task for 3 blocks. The first block is only the task, the second block played their musical sequence before presenting the task, the third block played their musical sequence as well but manipulated the last note of the musical sequence to a random note on random trials. 
The drop in accuracy and increase in the reaction time in the incongruent trials are a motivation to indeed create a similar study in VR and record with EEG. The change of the last note in random trials are to see whether the subjects elicit the N400 response that is observed in semantically incongruent endings to a sentence.
